# Introduction to Julia

Julia is a new emerging high-level, high-performance programming language. In other words, it aims to be simple to write and fast to run. Because of this, it has gained a lot of visibility among various fields of science such as astronomy, biology, finance, and statistics. In this course, we will start from the beginning and learn the basic concepts of programming with Julia. We will also discuss selected Julia packages and give an introduction to the Julia ecosystem such as BioJulia, JuliaAstro, and JuliaStats. The course contains both lectures and hands-on exercises.


## Learning outcome
After the course participants understand the basics of Julia and are capable of writing simple programs with it. We will also cover the very basics of how to design applications for more demanding computational jobs using Julia's parallel computing capabilities. Finally, the participants will be introduced to the Julia code ecosystem.


## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have some experience in computer programming and to be familiar with the basic concepts (e.g. variables, statements, control structures, functions) but previous knowledge of Julia is not required.
