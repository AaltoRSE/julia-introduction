# Introduction to Julia

This repository contains the content for the Introduction to Julia course at CSC.

Julia is a new emerging high-level, high-performance programming language. It aims to be simple to write and fast to run. In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts of programming with Julia. We will also discuss selected Julia packages and give an introduction to the Julia ecosystem. The course contains both lectures and hands-on exercises. All the material is provided as interactive notebooks.

The course is aimed for everybody with beginner to intermediate level of skills in programming. However, the notebooks and exercises contain extra material marked with **Advanced** tags, that can be of interest to the more experienced users too. Don't feel overwhelmed by them, some of them can be very specific to some particular field. Instead, if you find some of them interesting, feel free to just mess around with them and have some fun. That is the whole point of programming with a high-level language anyway!



## Prerequisites
Participants are expected to have some experience in computer programming and to be familiar with the basic concepts (e.g. variables, statements, control structures, functions) but previous knowledge of Julia is not required.
